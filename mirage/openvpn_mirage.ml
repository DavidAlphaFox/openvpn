(* An OpenVPN layer for MirageOS. Given a stackv4 and a configuration, it
   connects to the OpenVPN gateway in tun mode. Once the tunnel is established,
   an IPv4 stack is returned. *)

(* This effectful OpenVPN client layer is mostly reactive - only when some
   event occured, such as receiving data from the tunnel, a read failure
   (which immediately closes the connection), or a timer `Tick (once every
   second), or an user wants to transmit data (write) over the tunnel, work
   will be done.

   The asynchronous task library lwt is in use here, which provides cooperative
   tasks -- not preemptive tasks! This means that only at yield points
   (Lwt.bind (>>=) and Lwt.map (>|=)) other tasks can be scheduled. Everything
   between two yield points will happen atomically!

   Speaking of tasks, there are three tasks involved:
   - reader -- which is reading from a given TCP flow (started once
               TCP.create_connection successfully established a connection)
   - timer -- which sleeps for a second, produces a `Tick, in a loop
   - event -- which waits for events (generated by reader and timer), calling
              Openvpn.handle for each event, and executing potential actions
              asynchronously (via Lwt.async handle_action)

   Synchronisation is achieved by Lwt_condition.t variables, there are three:
   * data_cond which gets signalled when payload has been received over the
               tunnel (it is waited for by process_data)
   * est_cond which gets signalled once the tunnel is established. connect waits
              for that before returning
   * event_cond which gets signalled by timer/reader/handle_action whenever an
                event occured *)
